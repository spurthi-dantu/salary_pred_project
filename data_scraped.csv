/yr (est.)","What You Will Do

This position will be filled at either the Scientist 1 or 2 level, depending on the skills of the selected candidate. Additional job responsibilities will be assigned if the candidate is hired at the higher level.

The Materials and Physical Data group (XCP-5) in the Computational Physics Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is an interdisciplinary group which develops, implements, and validates constitutive models (material strength, damage and failure, etc.), equations of state (EOS), and physical data libraries including opacities and nuclear cross sections for use in large-scale simulation codes; additionally, some group members collaborate in the design and analysis of small-scale and integral validation experiments for material models and physical data. XCP-5 offers an exciting, flexible, scientifically challenging work environment with many opportunities to collaborate with the broader LANL scientific community. We are currently seeking highly motivated candidates to join our nuclear data team.

The nuclear data team in XCP-5 performs a wide range of activities along the nuclear data pipeline, from evaluations of nuclear data, their processing, their validation through the use of open and protected integral benchmarks, the creation of continuous-energy and multi-group data libraries for a range of applications, and the development and/or modernization of computing tools (e.g., NJOY21) to perform all the complex operations that sustain this pipeline. The nuclear data team works closely with other teams at the laboratory (e.g., MCNP®, PARTISN, nuclear theory and data evaluators, LANSCE for neutron-induced experiments, radiochemists, integral benchmarks experimentalists, statisticians and AI/ML experts, and many others) to apply novel techniques to nuclear data problems, and also interact with and support nuclear data users. Team members are very active in participating and leading various national and international efforts through organizations such as the Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG), the Nuclear Data Working Group (NDWG/WANDA), the OECD-NEA/WPEC, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), etc., and continually foster connections to universities to mentor students.


XCP-5 is seeking highly motivated early- to mid-career candidates to develop higher fidelity nuclear data libraries to be used primarily in simulations for stockpile stewardship and global security applications. Considerable effort is underway at LANL and elsewhere to improve the measurements of relevant data, the theory used to describe these reactions, the uncertainties in both, and understand their impact on these applications. The successful candidate will work with these communities, both nationally and internationally, to help develop, implement, and validate new physics models/data libraries and support their use. This position is particularly focused on the development, maintenance, and modernization of computational tools-e.g., NJOY, application/data interfaces, and workflow management tools-in use daily by scientists both at LANL and worldwide.


In addition to what was outlined at the Scientist 1 level, at this level at this level you will be expected to be more self-guided and motivated in contributing to the tasks outlined above. You will be expected to have a more in-depth background in work on tools like NJOY, along with additional experience integrating and working within a team and interfacing with a user community.
Additional job responsibilities will be assigned if the candidate is hired at the higher level.

Data Science and Visualization Specialist - Product Design,-1,"Summary

Posted: Dec 15, 2023

Role Number:200495248

The Data Science and Visualization (DataViz) team at Apple is currently seeking an enthusiastic team player to join our small, supportive, inclusive, and dynamic team as a Data Scientist and Visualization Specialist. The DataViz team collaborates with a variety of partners within Apple to distill data into actionable and intuitive visualizations that drive informed decisions. We work cooperatively to understand challenging problems that arise during all stages of product design at Apple. The job requires collaborative work, fluency using statistics and visualizations to answer specific questions about datasets, proficient programming skills in R or Python, and most importantly, a passion for creating informative visualizations and presentations to communicate results to all levels of the company. We encourage anyone who approaches problem solving with curiosity and imagination to apply. We value people with a desire to learn new skills and a mindset that views challenging questions as opportunities for insight. The DataViz team enables data-driven decision making by performing analysis, modeling, and visualization of unstructured data for engineering and research design teams. Our unique position within the organization allows us to assist other teams on a wide range of products designed at Apple. Our work impacts products used by millions of people worldwide.



Key Qualifications





Description

As a member of this team-oriented, collaborative group, you will be working on the latest, most innovative Apple products together with many cross-functional teams. Your responsibilities will include some of the following activities: - Writing scripts to preprocess data from various sources and formats. - Conducting data exploration on datasets, QA/QC, visualization, statistical and data analyses, and mathematical modeling. - Creating custom visualizations that help decision makers quickly understand the data. - Collaborating with cross-functional teams to help identify trends in their data or to build tools that will enable easier analysis and visualizations in the future. The role will require close collaboration with DataViz team members and members of other cross-functional teams, with many opportunities to practice and grow communication skills. You’ll have a lot of latitude to define how you work; specific tools matter less than the lateral thinking they enable. This is a truly unique opportunity that exposes you to many different teams at Apple.



Education & Experience

Masters degree in an analytical field such as (but not limited to) Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Applied Math, Physics, Biological Sciences, Robotics, Climate or Environmental Science, Computer Graphics, or Animation, along with 2+ years relevant work experience.

The research has also been used to produce the world’s first empirically-derived estimate of the social cost of carbon — the cost to society from each ton of carbon dioxide emitted. This figure will be continuously updated as research progresses and can serve as the basis for energy and climate policies.

However, their limited ability to leverage tabular data leaves a considerable share of enterprise data untapped. It is SAP's mission to overcome this challenge within the realm of Business AI. Our goal is to adapt Foundation Models to SAP data, enabling our clients to solve their business processes more effectively.

WPI seeks to hire a research scientist to join our research team, which includes faculty and students for the NIH-funded pain IMPACT project.

WPI is passionate about creating an inclusive workplace that promotes and values diversity. We are looking for candidates who can support our commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion.



Chronic pain impacts 50 million US adults and over-reliance on pain opioids has caused an epidemic in which 29% of chronic pain patients abuse opioids, 6% transition to heroin, and 130 people die daily from opioid overdose. Complementary, non-pharmacological pain treatments can reduce our country's reliance on opioids. However, while some complementary pain management methods, such as acupuncture and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction effectively reduce the pain of some patients, others do not respond. As clinicians lack objective tools to predict which patients will respond, many months and precious dollars are spent treating patients that may never respond. In collaboration with researchers at the Boston Medical Center (BMC) and UMass Medical School, our team is conducting research to develop AI models that utilize a combination of psychosocial, activity and neurobehavioral biomarkers extracted from sensor and questionnaire data, to predict which lower back pain patients will respond to MBSR. The AI will analyze the results of a series of pre-treatment tests on the patient. Our team will build off our prior work on AI models that detect pain from its disruptions of a patients' biorhythms (sleep-wake cycle) by analyzing data from commodity activity trackers such as Fitbit.

Responsibilities and Position Details:

Besides participating in research resulting in quality publications, the research scientist will also program data science frameworks to carry out machine/deep learning experiments at scale on live data, assist in managing and quality testing the project software project, coordinating the research of undergraduate and graduate students, managing and integrating project tasks across the team, and preparing project deliverables for the sponsor. Funding for the research data scientist position is available for 18 months; with a likely extension for a total of 4 years.

Example tasks to be undertaken the research data scientist include:
Feature engineering including circadian rhythm feature extraction from health tracker sensor and questionnaire data.
